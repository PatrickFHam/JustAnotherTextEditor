## User Story
```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```


## Description 

- **What was your motivation?** It is nice to have a 'scratchpad' handy, so you can jot down your ideas, even while not connected to the Internet... so that you can come back to those ideas later.
- **What problem does it solve?** This app allows people to quickly, and even offline, jot down their ideas and saves them for later.
- **What did you learn?** A lot about Webpack and Service-Workers.
